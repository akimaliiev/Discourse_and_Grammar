# üåê SyntaxAI ‚Äî Advanced Syntax Tree Generator App

**SyntaxAI** is an advanced mobile application built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and powered by [`expo-router`](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/), designed for **linguistic analysis**, **syntax visualization**, and **AI-enhanced explanation** of **phrase structure grammars**.

Users can input complex or simple sentences and receive:
- **Syntactic trees** generated from underlying **grammar rules**
- **Discourse-level analyses** based on multi-clause structures
- **AI explanations** based on linguistic theory (e.g., constituency, dependency grammar)
- Interactive and educational experience for linguists, students, and NLP enthusiasts
