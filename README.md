# 🌐 SyntaxAI — Advanced Syntax Tree Generator App

**SyntaxAI** is an advanced React Native application powered by [`expo-router`](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/), designed for linguistic analysis and syntactic tree generation. It enables users to input sentences and visualize their grammatical structure through dynamically generated trees, with AI-assisted explanations and context awareness.

This project combines **natural language processing**, **interactive syntax visualization**, and **AI integrations** to deliver a powerful educational and research-oriented mobile experience.

## 📆 Tech Stack Overview

| Stack | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Expo (React Native)** | Cross-platform mobile development |
| **Expo Router** | File-based navigation |
| **Supabase** | Auth, database, storage, and RLS |
| **React Native Paper** | Theming and UI components |
| **DeepSeek API** | AI-powered syntax analysis |
| **TypeScript** | Type-safe development |
| **Custom NLP Modules** | Syntax parsing, validation, and rendering |

## 🗺️ Project Setup

SyntaxAI Development Roadmap
{% comment %} Each phase corresponds to major milestones in product development. This can be useful for project planning and tracking. {% endcomment %}

📌 Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
 Initialize project with with-router template

 ESLint and Prettier setup

 Supabase auth & DB schema

 Row-Level Security (RLS) configured

 React Native Paper with custom theme

 Git branching strategy established

🗪 [Insert Screenshot: Supabase Table Setup]

🔐 Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
 Login, registration, and password reset screens

 Supabase context for session management

 Profile screen with editable avatar

 Language preference setting (planned)

🎨 [Insert Screenshot: Login & Profile Screens]

🌲 Phase 3: Syntax Tree Generation Engine
🧩 Tree Visualization
TreeView renders hierarchical syntax trees

Responsive and touch-friendly layout

Expand/collapse/zoom/reset controls

🧠 Tree Parsing and Generation
Grammar rule parsing and tree construction

TreeNode structure for visualization

Tree validation and error messaging

Multi-language grammar support (EN, RU upcoming)

🗃️ Tree Management
Saving trees per user session

History view with timestamps

Tree editing & planned export (SVG, PNG)

🤖 Phase 4: AI Integration
🔌 AI Service
DeepSeek API integration

Rate limiting and error fallback

Grammar-aware prompts for clarity

Contextual replies for related queries

💬 Chat UI
Lightweight chat bubble interface

Chat history and scroll sync

Typing indicators and retry options

🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
✅ Testing
Unit tests for UI and tree logic

Integration tests for auth and routing

Performance benchmarks for rendering speed

Security checks (Supabase tokens, XSS prevention)

🚀 Deployment
Production Expo config

Monitoring and crash reporting

Analytics (user flows, engagement)

Backup and RLS rule audits

🔿 Development Standards
✅ Code Quality
Strict TypeScript usage

Modular, well-documented components

Centralized utilities and reusable hooks

Versioned, meaningful Git commits

⚡ Performance Optimization
Tree rendering optimized via memoization

Lazy loading and debounce on input

Batched API calls and response caching

🔐 Security Practices
Supabase RLS restricts data to owners

No sensitive local storage

JWT tokens encrypted in context

📊 Key Metrics of Success
Metric	Description
User Engagement	Time on tree screen, input frequency
Tree Accuracy	Match against gold-standard parses
AI Quality	Relevance, clarity, correctness
Performance	FPS, latency, memory usage
Retention	Weekly/monthly returning users
Error Rate	API fail % and crashes
Response Time	Supabase + AI latency avg
